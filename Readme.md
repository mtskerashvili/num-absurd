A mathematical framework that extends traditional field theory to allow division by zero in an algebraically consistent manner. This repository contains implementations of Absurd Algebra in multiple programming languages.

### Key Properties

- **Division by Zero**: `1/0 = z`, where `z` is the absurd unit
- **Information Preservation**: Unlike infinity-based approaches, division by zero preserves mathematical information
- **Algebraic Consistency**: Maintains most standard arithmetic operations while extending capability
- **Backward Compatibility**: Pure complex numbers work as expected within the framework

## Academic Reference

This implementation is based on the paper:
